# PhotoMaker
In this Project I am using the Python Library OpenCV as well as the Haar cascades found on https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades . Using the Face as well as the eye and glasses xml files I am able to find the persons face. From finding the face it will take a picture of it, if and only if the person has two eyes open then it will take the picture from which the user will be prompted again to see if they would like another picture or to leave the program or even leave themselves on the 'idle' mode which allows the user to experiment with the face and eye detection
## What is needed inorder to run program
- python run enviorment
- python opencv library
- camera 
### After photos are taken they are going to be stored into the directory that contains the SELFIE.PY file
